// 1. Pre-Processor Directives: Use preprocessor directive #include to connect this software with other modules
#include <stdio.h> // Diamond braces are used to include system libraries. In this case "Standard I/O"
#include "uart.h"  // Quates are used to include user libraries. In this case "uart module"

// 2. Global Declaration: Include global variables and function prototypes for functions defined in this module

//    Global Variables

//    Function Prototypes: Compiler aid for "type checking"
unsigned long Calc_Area(unsigned long s); // Expects a unsigned long and returns an unsigned long

// 3. Functions/Subroutines:

//    MAIN: Mandatory routine for the C program to be executable
int main(void) {
  unsigned long side; // Room wall in meters. unsigned = no negative, long = 32bit number, side = variable name
  unsigned long area; // Area of the room in squared meters

  UART_Init();        // Call subroutine to initialize the uart
  printf("This program calculates the area of a square room");
  
  side = 3;           // assign the value of 3 meters to var
  Calc_Area(side);    // Invoke area calculation function
  
  printf("Area of the room with side of %ld m is %ld sqr m\n",side,area);
}

// CALC_AREA: Function that calculates area of a square room based on the length of it's side
// Input: side of a room (unsigned long)
// Output: area of the room (unsigned long)
// Notes:
unsigned long Calc_Area(unsigned long s){
  unsigned long result; // Contains result of the area calculation
  results = s*s;        // Area calculation
}
